This assignment focuses on putting into practice the knowledge of reinforcement learning (RL) gained through AWS DeepRacer. The student built an RL model virtual car that can learn on its own based on the reward function and training configuration. The training configuration includes the time the model spent on training, the track it was trained on, and the type of algorithm given to it.
